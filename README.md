# Email classifier

An email classification application created during the project in the course CS4125 System analysis and design at University of Limerick. The application is a command cli capable of switching data prepocessing, used embeddingtypes and machine learning models to be able to train different machine learnings models. The models can then be used to classifying emails by using trained models. The application is designed to implement a set of design patterns to practise software design.

## Install
This application is designed for python 3.12.8 and requires additional dependencies installed by pip. It may work for older or newer python versions however this is not tested.

Make sure right python version is installed
```
python --version
```

Make sure latest version of pip is installed
```
pip --version
```

Clone repo
```
git clone https://github.com/chrnas/email-classifier.git
```

Install requirements
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Run application by entering root directory and run main.py
```
python main.py
```

Read the user guide in the *docs* folder for further guidance on application usage.

## Contributing

The application could be extended by adding additional futures for machine learning training such as new embeddings, new machine learning models and extra data preprocessing steps. Additional testing for application could also be added to enhance the quality, reliability, and maintainability of the application.
